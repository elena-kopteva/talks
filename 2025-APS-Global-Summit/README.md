**Title:**  Exact Analytical Solutions for Modeling Cosmological Black Holes  

**Venue/Date:** APS Global Summit, 2025 (online)  

**Abstract:** We construct exact solutions to Einsteinâ€™s equations for black holes in (i) expanding, inhomogeneous LTB cosmologies 
and (ii) static spacetimes with anisotropic media. By mapping horizons and test-particle motion, we envision these models as candidate 
benchmarks for environmental effects, ambient matter, fields, and topological defects, so that future analyses can better separate such 
effects from genuine strong-gravity signals.
